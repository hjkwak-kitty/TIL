## WebView

* If your app targets API level 21 or higher:  

    * The system  blocks mixed content and third party cookies by default. To allow mixed  content and third party cookies, use the  setMixedContentMode()and setAcceptThirdPartyCookies()methods respectively.

    * The system now intelligently chooses portions of the HTML      document to draw. This new default behavior helps to reduce memory      footprint and increase performance. If you want to      render the whole document at once, disable this optimization by calling      enableSlowWholeDocumentDraw().

    * If your app targets API levels lower than 21: The system  allows mixed content and third party cookies, and always renders the whole  document at once.

* public abstract void setMixedContentMode (int mode)

    * Configures the WebView's behavior when a secure origin attempts to load a resource from an insecure origin. By default, apps that target KITKAT or below default to MIXED_CONTENT_ALWAYS_ALLOW. Apps targeting LOLLIPOP default toMIXED_CONTENT_NEVER_ALLOW. The preferred and most secure mode of operation for the WebView is MIXED_CONTENT_NEVER_ALLOW and use of MIXED_CONTENT_ALWAYS_ALLOW is strongly discouraged.

    * MIXED_CONTENT_ALWAYS_ALLOW : 항상 허용

    * MIXED_CONTENT_COMPATIBILITY_MODE : 호환성 모드
